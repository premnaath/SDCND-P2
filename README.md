# SDCND-P2
Project 2 in Term 1 for Self-driving Car Nanodegree program by Udacity

## Purpose of this repo
This repo was created to hold all files related to project 2 of SDCND by Udacity.

## Project description in brief
In this project, you will use what you've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. You will train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, you will then try out your model on images of German traffic signs that you find on the web.

## Contents of this repo
1. folder - from_web - Contains resized traffic sign images from on which the model will be tested.
2. folder - images - Contains images for documentation
3. folder - traffic-signs-data - Contains the traffic sign data from German traffic sign database.
4. reflection.md - Project writeup
5. signames.scv - Integer labels to which the traffic signs correspond to.
6. Traffic_Sign_Classified.html - Downloaded IPython notebook as HTML document.
7. Traffic_Sign_Classified.ipynb - The IPython notebook which contains the all code for the project.
8. tsClassification.py, tsDataExploration.py, tsLeNet.py, tsLoadAndTestpy - Python files which were used to design validate and test a trained model.
9. web_img.p - Pickled file containing the downloaded images from web.
